# Getting Started

Set up ADSK’s spec-driven workflow in your project.

## Prerequisites

- An Agent Skills–compatible agent (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.)
- A project to work with (new or existing)

## Installation

Adopter guide (install, update, add your own skill): [docs/using-adsk.md](../../../docs/using-adsk.md).

### In your app (recommended)

```bash
npx skills add rhyanvargas/agentic-development-starter-kit
```

Skills land in `.agents/skills/`. Updates: from the app repo run `npx skills update` and choose **Project** (refreshes that repo’s `.agents/skills/`). Choose **Global** only if you installed with `-g`; **Both** only if you maintain project and hub copies. See [docs/using-adsk.md](../../../docs/using-adsk.md#3-get-updates-later).

### Global (all projects)

```bash
npx skills add rhyanvargas/agentic-development-starter-kit -g
```

Updates for a global install: `npx skills update` → **Global** (or **Both** if you also have a project copy).

### Use this kit repo directly

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rhyanvargas/agentic-development-starter-kit.git
cd agentic-development-starter-kit
```

Open in Cursor and run `/quick-start`, or activate `spec-driven-workflow`.

## First run

### Brownfield (existing projects)

1. Confirm ADSK skills are available
2. `/quick-start` (Cursor) or follow `references/brownfield-workflow.md`
3. `/extract-spec path/` (or write a current-behavior spec)
4. `/draft-spec` → plan / implement / review by size

### Greenfield (new projects)

1. `/quick-start` (or set verify commands in project rules)
2. `/draft-spec "your first feature"`
3. Follow `references/greenfield-workflow.md`

## Verify setup

1. Agent discovers `spec-driven-workflow` (and `devops-strategy-facilitator` if installed)
2. Cursor commands (optional): `/draft-spec`, `/plan-impl`, `/implement-spec`, `/review`, `/extract-spec`, `/quick-start`
3. In an **app** after CLI install: `.agents/skills/` has the skill folders
4. In **this kit repo**: `skills/` is package source; `.agents/skills/` and `.cursor/skills/` link to it

## Avoid overlapping SDD skills

Do **not** also install generic `spec-driven-development` packs (e.g. Addy Osmani’s or Warp’s) alongside ADSK — they compete for the same triggers and use different paths/templates. Use ADSK SDD as the spine; pair with recommended Superpowers skills for planning/TDD (see repo `recommended-skills.json`).
