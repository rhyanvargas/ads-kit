# Project Context

This rule helps Cursor understand YOUR project. Run `/quick-start` to automatically populate this with your codebase's actual patterns.

## Discovery Guidelines

When working in this codebase, follow these principles:

### Before Making Changes

1. **Explore first** — Scan the codebase to understand existing patterns before suggesting new ones
2. **Follow established conventions** — Match the style, naming, and structure already in use
3. **Ask when uncertain** — If architecture decisions aren't clear, ask rather than assume

### Architecture Awareness

- **Folder structure**: Respect the existing organization. Don't reorganize without discussion.
- **Dependencies**: Use libraries already in the project. Don't add new ones without asking.
- **Patterns**: Follow patterns evident in existing code, even if alternatives exist.

### What to Preserve

- Existing file organization and naming conventions
- Current state management approach
- Established API patterns and error handling
- Test structure and conventions

The section below is populated when you run /quick-start. 
Until then, Cursor will discover patterns by reading your codebase.

## Project Specifics

_Run `/quick-start` to auto-discover and document your project's architecture._

<!--
After running /quick-start, this section will contain:
- Your folder structure
- Internal libraries
- Key architectural decisions
- Reference files
